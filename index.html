            <h3>Shanghai - China's Biggest City</h3>
            <p>
              Apart from being the biggest city in China, Shanghai is also known to be
              China's "most populous city". It is China's fastest growing city that also 
              has a lot of influence from the Western cultures. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Shanghai has an amazing city life, more especially the night life. There
              is an amazing contrast between ancient Chinese architecture and modern
              architecture that makes this a city worth visiting.
            </p>
            <p>
              The food in Shanghai is most definitely also a must-try! Soup dumplings as well
              as steamed crab are just some of the delicious Chinese foods that are worth trying
              during a visit to the city of Shanghai.
